# autoYT

#this is a code for a automated yt channel
#I wanted to make a yt channel that posts 4 yt short videos a day every single day without me ever having to do anything
# For this I am making a python script that downloades Instagram reels using Instaloader API of the insta pages I follow,
# and then edits my channel banner on top of those reels and posts those videos to yt
